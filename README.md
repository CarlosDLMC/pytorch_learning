The total number of words for reaching the level B2 of a language is 3500.
Lingster academy provides for free a document with all of those words.

However, the meaning is not written and it takes a lot of time to translate all the words.
At the top of it, it would be nice to have a couple of sentences with each word so we can completely understand it's meaning.

The goal of this project is to read the lingster academy pdf with all words and generate a new one, with all of the words translated into Russian, Spanish and English
and a couple of sentences for each one.
The words will be readen from the pdf file using pypdf2, and the translations with the sentences will be generated by chatgpt (we will connect to chatgpt via API).
